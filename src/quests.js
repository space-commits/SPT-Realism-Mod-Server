Everyone is tired from the illusion of choice they were offered all this time, from having to work and buy either blue or red cigarettes. It’s happening everywhere, in every corner of the world. But here in Tarkov, we are honest with ourselves. We see it all in an already exaggerated way, without false values, when you don't just decide what laundry detergent is better at removing stains, but how to keep warm at night and where to find ammo to deal with the next lowlife who wants to kill you. Only in such an honest society, people show their true selves. What do you think? Okay, thanks for hearing me out. Some folks requested a fully packed M4.

But what’s even more surprising for me, it’s the contemporary art market. The value of art pieces by renowned artists grows every year. They are definitely talented, but the more you look at it, the more it seems that anything can be art. It can be a Rothko painting, a displaced urinal, or a bunch of garbage. However, in my opinion, the most amazing pieces of art are weapons, starting from the melee - which is already universally recognized as such and can be found in many museums - to an old AK or M4, which are beautiful as they are. But a weapon only transcends to true art when it becomes unique, one-of-a-kind, in the hands of someone who knows how to use it, who modifies it for his own needs, creating a masterpiece worthy of being displayed in the best of museums.
