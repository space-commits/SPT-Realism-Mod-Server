=================================IMPORTANT============================
I RECOMMEND BACKING UP YOUR PROFILE BEFORE PLAYING WITH THIS MOD. If you disable the med changes after having already starting the server with this mod installed, all your med's uses will still be affected. This means you will have IFAKs with 6 uses, that sort of thing.

The config.js can be modified using notepad or any text editor. Explanations for what each option does is given in that file.

If you have any other mods that modify player or bot health, loudouts, starting gear, movement, stamina, fall damage, or any ammo or armor values, trader assorts, global settings related to ballistics or armor, any mods that relate to bot loot generation,
then disable parts of my mod that might conflict that you don't want via the config, or choose this mod or the other.

Do note that my mod is built with all features in mind for the sake of balancing, so your experience may be degraded if you disable parts of it.

Any versions of my mod distributed with modified values is not representative of this mod's balance or goals.

I can't offer support if you try to play with incompatible mods or use a modified version of my mod with a modpack. 

If a lot of people want to play with a conflicting mod that's reasonable, I can try to see I can make a compatiblity patch, just contact me.

I do not recommend editing any values contained within this mod unless you know what you are doing, nor do I recommend applying any modifiers to the ammo or armor values using another mod. 
Everything I've changed had all the other changes of this mod in mind, changing anything might screw the balance! Things might get very whacky if you do, don't say I didn't warn you.
======================================================================

---About this mod---
This is a 'Realism' mod, it won't necessarily be balanced and some items may seem worthless, but that's how it is in real life :)

EFT's systems are very complex but don't lend themselves well to simulating these things accurately, so some liberties had to be taken.

I used many references to try and get the ammo and armor behaving as realistically as possible within the limits of EFT, but I can always get stuff wrong so please contact me if you think something seems off, with some references/evidence! 

In the 'info' folder there are two tables, one of all ammo vs. a 100 durability ceramic armor of each level, and one for pistol and shotgun ammo vs. aramid of 100 durability with class 1-5. 
This is a very rough guide and isn't an exact indication of TTK, and will become innacurate as ammo and armor values are tweaked over time.

There may be many bugs, fat-fingured values, etc. Let me know if something seems way off or strange. If you get any bot generation errors please send me the error with your player level.

It will take many iterations to get things right and many features need to be implemented to have things more 'balanced' and cohesive, I'd very much appreciate any feedback and suggestions!

Kiki again for helping me figure out how to get the tiered fleamarket workin, wouldn't have figured it out without them.
Katto for the code for function "SetHealth" taken from their excellent Server Value Modifier mod, with persimmion.
Fin for his method and code to make sure bots spawn with the correct mods.
Chomp, Crow, Alex, Fin, ThurmanMurman, SamSWAT, CWX, Eresh, and many others for all their help and putting up with my dumb questions :)
